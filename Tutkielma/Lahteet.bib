	abstract={We present a set of artistic choices and novel real-time shading techniques which support each other to enable the unique rendering style of the game Team Fortress 2 . Grounded in the conventions of early 20th century commercial illustration, the look of Team Fortress 2 is the result of tight collaboration between artists and engineers. In this paper, we will discuss the way in which the art direction and technology choices combine to support artistic goals and gameplay constraints. In addition to achieving a compelling style, the shading techniques are designed to quickly convey geometric information using rim highlights as well as variation in luminance and hue, so that game players are consistently able to visually "read" the scene and identify other players in a variety of lighting conditions.},

	abstract={In this paper, we introduce a compact random-access vector representation for solid textures made of intermixed regions with relatively smooth internal color variations. It is feature-preserving and resolution-independent. In this representation, a texture volume is divided into multiple regions. Region boundaries are implicitly defined using a signed distance function. Color variations within the regions are represented using compactly supported radial basis functions (RBFs). With a spatial indexing structure, such RBFs enable efficient color evaluation during real-time solid texture mapping. Effective techniques have been developed for generating such a vector representation from bitmap solid textures. Data structures and techniques have also been developed to compactly store region labels and distance values for efficient random access during boundary and color evaluation.},

	abstract={We present a massively parallel vector graphics rendering pipeline that is divided into two components. The preprocessing component builds a novel adaptive acceleration data structure, the shortcut tree . Tree construction is efficient and parallel at the segment level, enabling dynamic vector graphics. The tree allows efficient random access to the color of individual samples, so the graphics can be warped for special effects. The rendering component processes all samples and pixels in parallel. It was optimized for wide antialiasing filters and a large number of samples per pixel to generate sharp, noise-free images. Our sample scheduler allows pixels with overlapping antialiasing filters to share samples. It groups together samples that can be computed with the same vector operations using little memory or bandwidth. The pipeline is feature-rich, supporting multiple layers of filled paths, each defined by curved outlines (with linear, rational quadratic, and integral cubic Bézier segments), clipped against other paths, and painted with semi-transparent colors, gradients, or textures. We demonstrate renderings of complex vector graphics in state-of-the-art quality and performance. Finally, we provide full source-code for our implementation as well as the input data used in the paper.},

We use the svg() graphics device inR and then post-process the resulting XML documents. The post-processing identifies the elements in the SVG that correspond to the different components of the graphical display, e.g., points, axes, labels, lines. One can then annotate these elements to add interactivity and animation effects. One can also use JavaScript to provide dynamic interactive effects to the plot, enabling rich user interactions and compelling visualizations. The resulting SVG documents can be embedded within HTML documents and can involve JavaScript code that integrates the SVG and HTML objects. The functionality is provided via the SVGAnnotation package and makes static plots generated viaR graphics functions available as stand-alone, interactive and animated plots for the Web and other venues.},

	title={Breaking the Pixel Barrier},
	abstract={Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging The majority of the current advances in computer graphic rendering strive for fast and realistic creation of pixel images, e. g., for the film and gaming industry. This development, unfortunately, leads to various problems due to limitations of pixel images, in particular, when they are not used for screen viewing. Thus, in this paper we argue for the placement of greater emphasis on the generation of vector graphics. Vector graphics offer the best approach for achieving effectiveness for both media simulation and illustration techniques. We discuss advantages of using vector graphics, pose a number of questions in this context, and evaluate directions of further research.},

	abstract={For thirty years, resolution-independent 2D standards (e.g. PostScript, SVG) have depended on CPU-based algorithms for the filling and stroking of paths. Advances in graphics hardware have largely ignored accelerating resolution-independent 2D graphics rendered from paths. We introduce a two-step "Stencil, then Cover" (StC) programming interface. Our GPU-based approach builds upon existing techniques for curve rendering using the stencil buffer, but we explicitly decouple in our programming interface the stencil step to determine a path's filled or stroked coverage from the subsequent cover step to rasterize conservative geometry intended to test and reset the coverage determinations of the first step while shading color samples within the path. Our goals are completeness, correctness, quality, and performance---yet we go further to unify path rendering with OpenGL's established 3D and shading pipeline. We have built and productized our approach to accelerate path rendering as an OpenGL extension.},

A distance field is generated from a high resolution image, and then stored into a channel of a lower-resolution texture. In the simplest case, this texture can then be rendered simply by using the alpha-testing and alpha-thresholding feature of modern GPUs, without a custom shader. This allows the technique to be used on even the lowest-end 3D graphics hardware. With the use of programmable shading, the technique is extended to perform various special effect renderings, including soft edges, outlining, drop shadows, multi-colored images, and sharp corners.},

	abstract={We present a method for resolution independent rendering of paths and bounded regions, defined by quadratic and cubic spline curves, that leverages the parallelism of programmable graphics hardware to achieve high performance. A simple implicit equation for a parametric curve is found in a space that can be thought of as an analog to texture space. The image of a curve's Bézier control points are found in this space and assigned to the control points as texture coordinates. When the triangle(s) corresponding to the Bézier curve control hull are rendered, a pixel shader program evaluates the implicit equation for a pixel's interpolated texture coordinates to determine an inside/outside test for the curve. We extend our technique to handle anti-aliasing of boundaries. We also construct a vector image from mosaics of triangulated Bézier control points and show how to deform such images to create resolution independent texture on three dimensional objects.},
